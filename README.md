### About Me

I have a degree in **Physics** and a minor in **Mathematics** from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Most of the projects I create are for solving physics and mathematics problems, while the rest are for fun.

### Current Projects

- **Mathematics.NET**: Mathematics.NET is a C# class library that provides tools for solving mathematical problems.
  - Custom types for complex, real, and rational numbers as well as other mathematical objects such as vectors, matrices, and tensors.
  - Automatic Differentiation: both forward and reverse mode autodiff are supported.
    - Perform forward mode, first and second order autodiff using dual and hyper-dual numbers.
    - Perform reverse mode, first and second order autodiff using gradient and Hessian tapes.
  - Support for many operations in differential geometry such as tensor contractions and index manipulations.
  - OpenCL support for some basic mathematical operations.
- **Physics.NET**: Physics.NET is a C# class library for performing calculations in General Relativity, QFT, Statistical Mechanics, and Classical Mechanics. (I am currently moving some of the features from this library to Mathematics.NET.)
  - Support for units and dimensional analysis.
