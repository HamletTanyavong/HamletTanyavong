### About Me
I have a degree in Physics and a minor in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Most of the projects I create are for solving physics and mathematics problems, while the rest are for fun.

For general inquiries about my projects, or if you have any questions regarding math and physics, please visit my Discord server [Physics & Mathematics](https://discord.gg/haqS9TVK8B).

### Current Projects
- **Mathematics.NET**: Mathematics.NET is a C# class library that provides tools for solving mathematical problems.
  - Custom types for complex, real, and rational numbers as well as other mathematical objects such as vectors, matrices, and tensors.
  - Automatic Differentiation: Perform autodiff using dual and hyper-dual numbers. First and second-order, forward and reverse-mode autodiff are all supported.
- **Physics.NET**: Physics.NET is a C# class library for performing calculations in General Relativity, QFT, Statistical Mechanics, and Classical Mechanics.
  - Create animations to visualize physical and mathematical systems.
- **Writing & Literature**: This is a set of tools that will help users with writing and performing searches on published works.
  - API.
  - Web application.
  - Discord App: Many of these tools will be available through a Discord application.

### Other
Activities I enjoy include reading, writing, digital art, gaming, and track & field.
