### About Me
I have a degree in Physics and a minor in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Most of the projects I create are for solving physics and mathematics problems, while the rest are for fun.

### Current Projects

  - Custom types for complex, real, and rational numbers as well as other mathematical objects such as vectors, matrices, and tensors
- **Physics.NET**: Physics.NET is a C# class library for performing calculations in General Relativity, QFT, Statistical Mechanics, and Classical Mechanics.
  - Automatic Differentiation: perform autodiff using dual and hyper-dual numbers.
  - Create animations to visualize physical and mathematical systems.
- **Writing & Literature**: This is a set of tools that will help users with writing and performing searches on published works.
  - API
  - Web application
  - Discord App: Many of these tools will be available through a Discord application. Visit the support server [here](https://discord.gg/ga62UCHwsP).
